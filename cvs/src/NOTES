Notes on the sources


modifications by me (misc)


added
-----


cvs_prints(...) 
	variadic macro, prints everything via cvs_output (if needed) or to stdout

cvs_printf(fmt,...)
	same, but uses printf


colors: 
	macro COLOR(name)
		return either "", if "noclors" is set (switch -C),
		or the according color. defined in colors.c

several options. mostly marked with a comment "misc"
	

---

config is parsed in parseinfo.c

cvs_output should be replaced with cvs_printf
 (many unneccessary mallocs and calls to strlen)


cvs_error is replaced with a macro.
with the compileswitch _DCVSDEBUG 
cvs_error now also reports FILE and LINE
cvs_error is also used for verbose messages at some places.


There's a huge bunch of linked lists.


Maybe I should have written myself an wrapper to rcs, or sccs.
But I like a mature and prooved system.

Dates are formatted in a hard to parse format.

Missing checksums.

Missing templates for output.

I didn't even try to understand what server.c does.
