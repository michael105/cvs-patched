modifications by me (misc)


added
-----


definition switch CVSDEBUG
  cvserr will also report line and location
  cvserr is also used for verbose messages at some places.

cvs_prints(...) 
	variadic macro, prints everything via cvs_output (if needed) or to stdout
	only for strings, no formatting

cvs_printf(fmt,...)
	same, but uses printf


colors: 
	macro COLOR(name)
		return either "", if "noclors" is set (switch -C),
		or the according color. defined in colors.c

several options. mostly marked with a comment "misc"
	

	todo: diff - marked places, set colors.
		(getenv?) beste loesung. sonst zersplittert.
		oder longopts.?
		 //diff.c in cvs: add option -q quiet
		 noe. ist schon global implementiert.

notes

config is parsed in parseinfo.c

cvs_output should be replaced with cvs_printf
 (many unneccessary mallocs and calls to strlen)

should also have cvs_fwrite

There's a huge bunch of linked lists.


Maybe I should have written myself an wrapper to rcs, or sccs.
But I like a mature and prooved system.

Dates are formatted in a hard to parse format.

Missing checksums.

Missing templates for output.

I didn't even try to understand what server.c does.
